    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>Holding a bachelor's degree in Informatics Engineering from the University of Western Macedonia and a passion for new technologies. I am looking for a new opportunity in IT. As a kid, messing with my computer's hardware, and using different types of software was a clear sign that computer science was the path to follow. I developed traits like teamwork, prioritization, time management, and organization, thanks to various roles. Web development is my latest passion, which I hope it becomes a succesful career path.</p>
